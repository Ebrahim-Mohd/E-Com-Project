This is a simple project where some products and their details are fetched from a MongoDB database and displayed in the home page. There is an cart feature that allows
you to add/remove products to/from your Cart. Products added to cart can be seen on the 'Cart' page. There is a 'category' option on the navigation bar that lets you view products
from a certain category.
